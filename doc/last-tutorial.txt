LAST Tutorial
=============

LAST finds similar regions between sequences, and aligns them.

Example 1: Compare the human and fugu mitochondrial genomes
-----------------------------------------------------------

For our first example, we wish to find and align similar regions
between the human and fugu mitochondrial genomes.  You can find these
sequences in the examples directory: humanMito.fa and fuguMito.fa.  We
can compare them like this:

  lastdb -c humdb humanMito.fa
  lastal humdb fuguMito.fa > myalns.maf

The lastdb command creates several files whose names begin with
"humdb".  The lastal command then compares fuguMito.fa to the humdb
files, and writes the alignments to a file called "myalns.maf".

The -c option causes lowercase letters to be soft-masked.  Lowercase
is often used to indicate repetitive regions, and soft-masking avoids
getting uninteresting repetitive alignments.

Understanding the output
------------------------

The output has very long lines, so you need to view it without
line-wrapping.  For example, with a Unix/Linux/MacOsX command line,
you can use:

  less -S myalns.maf

Each alignment looks like this:

  a score=85
  s humanMito 1742 289 + 16571 AGTATAGGCGATAGAAATTGAAACCTGGCGCAAT...
  s fuguMito  1182 300 + 16447 AGTATAGGAGATAGAAAAGGAA-CTAGGAGCTAT...

The score is a measure of how strong the similarity is.  Lines
starting with "s" contain: the sequence name, the start coordinate of
the alignment, the number of bases spanned by the alignment, the
strand, the sequence length, and the aligned bases.

The start coordinates are zero-based.  This means that, if the
alignment begins right at the start of a sequence, the coordinate is
0.  If the strand is "-", the start coordinate is in the reverse
strand.

This alignment format is called MAF (multiple alignment format), and
it is described in the UCSC Genome FAQ.  You can convert it to several
other formats using maf-convert.py, which accompanies LAST.

Example 2: Compare the cat and mouse genomes
--------------------------------------------

Although these sequences are much larger, we can compare them in the
same way as the mitochondrial genomes:

  lastdb -v -c mousedb mouse/chr*.fa
  lastal -v mousedb cat/chr*.fa > myalns.maf

This might take half a day, and use perhaps 9 gigabytes of memory.  If
you do not have enough memory, then investigate lastdb's -s option.
The -v (verbose) option just makes it write progress messages on the
screen.

Example 3: Compare vertebrate proteins to invertebrate proteins
---------------------------------------------------------------

Use the lastdb -p option to indicate that the sequences are proteins:

  lastdb -p -c invdb invertebrate.fa
  lastal invdb vertebrate.fa

Example 4: Compare DNA sequences to protein sequences
-----------------------------------------------------

  lastdb -p -c protdb proteins.fa
  lastal -F15 protdb dnas.fa

The -F15 option specifies translated alignment, with a score penalty
of 15 for frameshifts.

Example 5: Calculate E-values of alignment scores
-------------------------------------------------

lastal reports alignments whose score is at least some minimum value,
e.g. 40.  If this value is too high we may miss meaningful alignments,
but if it is too low we may find meaningless alignments.

To solve this dilemma, it is useful to know what alignment scores are
likely between completely random sequences.  For example, let us find
what alignment scores are likely between two random sequences with the
same lengths and base frequencies as the human and fugu mitochondrial
genomes:

  lastdb -x humdb humanMito.fa
  lastdb -x fugdb fuguMito.fa
  lastex humdb.prj fugdb.prj

The lastdb commands count bases, and write them in files called
humdb.prj and fugdb.prj.  The -x option tells it to only count bases
and skip its usual preparation steps.  The lastex command prints a
table of scores and expected numbers of alignments.  Here is an
abbreviated version:

  Score	     Expected number of alignments
  39	     8.44e-11
  22	     0.00805
  20	     0.0699
  12	     398

This tells us, for example, that there will be on average 398
alignments of score 12 or more between random sequences with these
lengths and base frequencies.  Also, 22 is the minimum score such that
the average number of alignments is no more than 0.01.

Finally, we can find alignments with score at least 22 like this:

  lastdb -c humdb humanMito.fa
  lastal -e22 humdb fuguMito.fa > myalns.maf

Example 6: Align human DNA reads to the human genome
----------------------------------------------------

Let's assume we have DNA reads in a file called reads.fastq, in
fastq-sanger format.  We can align them to the human genome like this:

  lastdb -m1111110 humandb human/chr*.fa
  lastal -Q1 humandb reads.fastq > myalns.maf

The funny-looking -m1111110 option makes it better at finding short,
strong alignments.  (The default settings are tuned for long, weak
alignments.)  The -Q1 option indicates that the reads are in
fastq-sanger format.

Often, one read will align to more than one genome location.  You can
use last-map-probs.py to help judge which location reflects the origin
of the read.  Please see the "typical usage" recipe in
last-map-probs.txt.

If you have paired end reads, then last-pair-probs.py may be useful
(see last-pair-probs.txt).

Fastq format confusion
----------------------

Unfortunately, there is more than one fastq format, and you have to
know which one your data is in.  Recently (2010) we usually see either
fastq-sanger or fastq-illumina.  If you have fastq-illumina format,
use option -Q3 instead of -Q1.

Alignment scoring schemes
-------------------------

The default DNA scoring scheme used by lastal is tuned for finding
long, weak alignments.  It is:

  match score = 1,  mismatch cost = 1,  gap cost = 7 + 1 * (gap length),
  minimum alignment score = 40

However, if you use option -Q1 (or -Q3), it uses a different scoring
scheme tuned for finding short, strong alignments:

  match score = 6,  mismatch cost = 18,  gap cost = 21 + 9 * (gap length),
  minimum alignment score = 180

In the next two examples, we set the scoring scheme by hand.

Example 7: Align human fasta reads to the human genome
------------------------------------------------------

Suppose we have DNA reads in fasta format (without quality data)
instead of fastq.  We need to omit the -Q option, but we wish to use
the same scoring scheme as -Q1:

  lastdb -m1111110 humandb human/chr*.fa
  lastal -r6 -q18 -a21 -b9 -e180 genomedb reads.fa

Example 8: Align aardvark fastq reads to the human genome
---------------------------------------------------------

In this case we need to use the -Q option, but we wish to find weak
alignments:

  lastdb -c humandb human/chr*.fa
  lastal -Q1 -r5 -q5 -a35 -b5 humandb reads.fastq > myalns.maf

This example uses a scaled version of the default alignment scores
(1:1:7:1 -> 5:5:35:5).  The reason for this is to put them on roughly
the same scale as the fastq quality scores.

lastal uses the quality scores to modify the alignment scores, and
then rounds the modified scores to integers.  By using scaled
alignment scores, we reduce the information loss caused by rounding.

Very short reads
----------------

WARNING!  The default score parameters do not align very short reads.
This is because the match score is 6 and the score threshold is 180,
so at least 30 high-quality matches are required (or a greater number
of low-quality matches).  To align very short reads, reduce the score
threshold (lastal -e).

If the score threshold is too low, you will get meaningless, random
alignments.  You might also need to adjust lastal -d, which defaults
to e*3/5: if it is too low, lastal becomes slow.

Example 9: Ambiguity of alignment columns
-----------------------------------------

Consider this alignment:

  TGAAGTTAAAGGTATATGAATTCCAATTCTTAACCCCCCTATTAAACGAATATCTTG
  |||||| | ||||||     |    | || |      ||||||   |||||||||||
  TGAAGTGAGAGGTATGGTTTTGAGTAGTCCT------CCTATTTTTCGAATATCTTG

The middle section has such weak similarity that its precise alignment
cannot be confidently inferred.

It is sometimes useful to estimate the ambiguity of each column in an
alignment.  We can do this using lastal option -j4:

  lastdb -c humdb humanMito.fa
  lastal -j4 humdb fuguMito.fa > myalns.maf

This gives us the probability that each aligned column is unambiguous.

These column probabilities have the following limitation.  Each
alignment is grown from a "core" region, which contains exact matches
only.  The column probabilities are contingent on the core being
correct, and pairings within the core automatically get a probability
of 1.
