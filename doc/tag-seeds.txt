Mapping tags to a genome with LAST
==================================

LAST has many adjustable parameters, providing many ways of mapping
tags to a genome.  We cannot tell you which way is best, but here are
some ideas that might be helpful.

1. A simple mapping procedure
-----------------------------

Suppose we wish to map tags of length 36 to the mouse genome.  Here is
one way to do it:

  lastdb -s16G mousedb mouse/chr*.fa
  lastal -a2 -e30 -f0 mousedb tags.fa

Here, we used -s16G to indicate that 16 gigabytes of memory are
available.  This will make lastal run faster.  If you don't have 16
gigabytes, omit this option.  We then used -a2 to set the gap
existence cost to 2, and -e30 to get alignments with score >= 30.  We
left the other score parameters at their default values: match score =
1, mismatch cost = 1, gap extension cost = 1.  These parameters allow
a few mismatches and/or a few small gaps.  The -f0 option simply
selects the compact tabular output format.

2. Using sequence quality data
------------------------------

You can use sequence quality data in FASTQ or PRB format to get more
accurate mappings.  For example:

  lastal -Q3 mousedb tags_prb.txt

Using quality data improves mapping accuracy only if the quality data
itself is accurate, which it might not be.

3. Dealing with multi-mapping tags
----------------------------------

Often, one tag will align to more than one genome location.  You can
use last-map-probs.py in the scripts directory to help judge which
location the tag really maps to.  This script calculates a mapping
probability for each alignment.  For example, if one tag aligns to two
locations with identical scores, then the probabilities will be 50:50.

4. How does the simple mapping procedure work: what are its limitations?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to understand how this mapping procedure works in more
detail, read on.  LAST uses a two-step approach: first find initial
matches, then extend alignments from these matches.  In this case, the
"initial matches" are: all exact matches of any part of a tag to the
genome, of any length, where the match occurs at most ten times in the
genome.

One consequence of this is that repetitive tags will not be mapped: if
a tag perfectly matches more than ten locations in the genome, it gets
dropped at the first step.

Another wrinkle is the effect of database volumes.  LAST is designed
to work with 2 gigabytes of memory, so it splits large
(e.g. mammalian) genomes into "volumes", and maps tags to each volume
in turn as if they were separate genomes.  If a tag perfectly matches
more than ten locations in one volume, but less than ten in another,
then the former matches will not be reported but the latter will.  You
can avoid this inconsistency by using -s16G to put the whole mouse
genome into one volume.  Even if the genome is in one volume, however,
the two strands get searched separately.

The main point is that this procedure does not guarantee to find all
alignments with score >= 30.  It is more likely to miss alignments
that have uniformly-spaced mismatches/gaps, and less likely to miss
alignments with mismatches/gaps concentrated at the ends.  We think it
does a good job in practice.

5. Counting exact matches
-------------------------

We can gain information on repetitive tags as follows:

  lastal -j0 -l36 mousedb tags.fa

Here, -j0 tells lastal to just report counts of initial matches.  In
this case, there is no limit on how often the matches occur: matches
that occur more than ten times in the genome are counted too.  So
nothing is missed, and there is no effect from database volumes.  The
-l36 option requests matches of length >= 36 only: this makes it
faster and makes the output smaller.  (Without -l36, it counts all
matches of length >= 1: this is still quite fast.)

6. Guaranteeing to map tags with up to N mismatches
---------------------------------------------------

Suppose we wish to find all matches of our length-36 tags to the
genome, allowing up to two mismatches.  A naive approach is to start
by finding all exact matches of length 12, and extend alignments from
these.  This works because any length-36 tag with two mismatches is
guaranteed to have an exact match of length 12.  It will be very slow,
however, because there will be many unproductive length-12 matches.

We can do better by finding matches using a spaced seed, and then
extending alignments.  For example, our tags are guaranteed to have a
match using this spaced seed pattern: 11111011000111110110001111.
Since this seed has 18 matched positions (18 "1"s), we will get far
fewer unproductive matches.  With LAST, we can do this as follows:

  lastdb -m11111011000 mydb genome.fa
  lastal -l26 -m4000000000 -j1 -q0 -d34 -n100 mydb tags.fa

In the lastdb command, the seed pattern gets cyclically repeated, so
we only need to specify the repeating unit of the pattern.  In the
lastal command, we used -l26 to get length-26 initial matches, and
-m4000000000 to accept hugely repeated initial matches.  We also used
-j1 to request gapless alignments, -q0 to set the mismatch cost to 0,
and -d34 to request alignments with score >= 34.  Finally, -n100
limits the output: if one tag has many matches, an arbitrary sample
(at least 100) of them will be returned.

The following table shows optimal spaced seed patterns for various tag
sizes and numbers of mismatches.  Each entry shows the match length
(e.g. 26) and the pattern (e.g. 11111011000).

This table was made using software kindly provided by the authors of

For longer tags, it becomes harder to determine the optimal seed patterns.

7. Merging identical tag sequences
-----------------------------------

Suppose we have tag sequences in a FASTA format file called "tags.fa":

  >tagA
  GGACAAAAACCAAAAAAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  >tagB
  GGACAAAAACCAAAAAAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  >tagC
  GGACAAAAACCAAAAAAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  >tagD
  GGCACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTGG

If there are many identical sequences, we can speed up the mapping by
merging them.  The following Unix pipeline merges identical sequences
(assuming each sequence is all on one line):

  grep -v '>' tags.fa | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print ">" NR ":" $1 "\n" $2}'

The output of this command looks as follows:

  >1:3
  GGACAAAAACCAAAAAAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  >2:1
  GGCACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTGG

The number after the colon is the count of the tag, and the number
before the colon is just a serial number.

8. How does lastal use sequence quality data?
---------------------------------------------

The quality scores have no effect on finding initial matches, but they
do affect extending alignments from the initial matches.  If quality
scores are used, the default alignment scoring scheme is +6 for a
high-quality match and -18 for a high-quality mismatch.  Low-quality
matches and mismatches get scores between these values, as shown in
the following table.  If your tags are very short, make sure that the
alignment score threshold does not exceed the tag length times 6,
otherwise you will not get any matches!
