# The HOXD70 score matrix was derived from aligned segments of human
# and mouse DNA (F Chiaromonte, VB Yap, W Miller, PSB 2002:115-126).
# It is the default score matrix for BLASTZ v7, along with a gap
# existence cost of 400 and a gap extension cost of 30.  The next line
# tells lastal to use these gap costs:

#lastal -a 400 -b 30

# Let's also specify a minimum alignment score of 4000:

#lastal -e 4000

# The accompanying E-value tables suggest that 4000 is not
# unreasonable for comparing gigabase-scale sequences.  In any case,
# you can override these parameter choices by setting options when
# running lastal.  Finally, here is the HOXD70 matrix:

     A    C    G    T
A   91 -114  -31 -123
C -114  100 -125  -31
G  -31 -125  100 -114
T -123  -31 -114   91
